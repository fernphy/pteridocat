Raw data files

- 2021-12-18_dwca.zip: Catalog of Life taxonomic data in Darwin Core Archive format downloaded from https://download.catalogueoflife.org/col/monthly/2021-12-18_dwca.zip.

- pterido_names_to_inspect_all.csv: Results of querying fern taxon names from the NCBI database against the Catalog of Life. Exported from Fern Tree of Life (FTOL) project.

- pterido_names_taxized_to_inspect.csv: Same as pterido_names_to_inspect_all.csv, but with data filled in automatically from tropicos and other data sources using taxize.

- pterido_names_taxized_inspected.csv: Same as pterido_names_taxized_to_inspect.csv, but with data filled in after manual inspection. pterido_names_taxized_inspected.xlsx (not tracked) may be used for editing data, and saved to pterido_names_taxized_inspected.csv.

- new_names.csv: New taxon names to add to the next version of pteridocat. These names do not fit the common pattern in pterido_names_taxized_inspected.csv of `use_query_as_synonym`, `use_query_as_accepted`, or `use_query_as_new`.
